Weekend 'catch-up sleep' is a lie
    The negative heath effects of skimping on sleep during the week can`t be reversed by marathon weekend sllep sessions, 
according to a sobering new study.

    Despite complete freedom to sleep in and nap during a weekend recovery period, participants in a sleep laboratory who where limited to five hours of sleep on weekdays
gained nearly three pounds over two weeks and experienced metabolic disruption that would increase their risk for diabetesd over the long term
.While weekend after a single week of insufficient sleep. those gains were wiped out when people plunged right back into their same sleep-deprived
schedule the next Monday
